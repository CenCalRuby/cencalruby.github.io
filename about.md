CenCal Ruby is a group of developers dedicated to Ruby and open source software. 

We strive to promote the continuing progress of the tech and software community in the Central California area. 

We meet once a month. We are still organizing the dates and times, but hope to have that nailed down by January 20th. Each meeting has a presentation by one of the members, lightning talks and social gathering.
