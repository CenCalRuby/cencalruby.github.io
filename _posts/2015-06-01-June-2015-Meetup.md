Our June meetup is here and we have a couple of talks scheduled. Derrik will be giving
a talk on real-time updating using web sockets and Frank will be talking about performance
tuneups in Ruby.

We want to thank Western Milling for sponsoring our group by taking care of
some of the costs associated with running the group. We also want
to thank Bitwise Industries for sponsoring us by hosting our meetup at their
offices.
