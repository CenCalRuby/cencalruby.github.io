Our April meetup has some exciting talks scheduled. Darin is going to be giving
a talk on low-level caching in Rails. Marcelo is going to be giving a talk on
RethinkDB (and RethinkDB has generously donated some give away items as well,
thanks to Marcelo). Anyone else who wants to give a quick lightning talk is
encouraged to do so.

We want to thank Western Milling for sponsoring our group by taking care of
some of the costs associated with running the group. Also J.D. Heiskell & Co.
has sponsored us as well and provide food and beer for this meetup. We also want
to thank Bitwise Industries for sponsoring us by hosting our meetup at their
offices.
