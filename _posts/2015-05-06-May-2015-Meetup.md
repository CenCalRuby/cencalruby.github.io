Our May meetup is here and we are short on talks scheduled. Joe will be giving a
talk on deployment strategies. Frank will be giving an introduction to rake
outside of rails. Anyone else who wants to give a quick lightning talk is
encouraged to do so.

We want to thank Western Milling for sponsoring our group by taking care of
some of the costs associated with running the group. Also J.D. Heiskell & Co.
has sponsored us as well and provide food and beer for this meetup. We also want
to thank Bitwise Industries for sponsoring us by hosting our meetup at their
offices.
