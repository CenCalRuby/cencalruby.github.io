Inaugural Meetup Complete
=======

I wanted to thank everyone who showed up to our inaugural meetup. It was great
to see everyone and meet some new people. I wanted to thank Joe for giving a
lightning talk on automating deployment on Heroku integrated with Travis CI. I
also wanted to thank everyone for letting me give my presentation as well and
for the discussions that ensued.

I wanted to extend our thanks to Western Milling, J.D. Heiskell & Co. and
Bitwise Industries for sponsoring our group. I look forward to the next
meeting on March 12, 2015, same place, same time. Remember that we are looking
for people to give lightning talks or presentations. We have a giveaway
scheduled for those who participate.
