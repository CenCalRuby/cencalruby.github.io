Inaugural Meetup Announced
=======

We are glad to announce that our inaugural meetup has been set for February 12,
2015 @ 6 PM. We will be meeting at Bitwise Industries in Fresno as they have
graciously agreed to be our host site.

Please RSVP here: <a

We are wanting to structure the meetup in a way that there is time for people to
chat, but also be able to share via a presentation or a lightning talk.

Frank West will be presenting in the first meetup on Test Doubles. If anyone
wants to give a lightning talk please just volunteer to do so. We would be glad
to be able to fit in as many people as possible.

We want to thank Western Milling for sponsoring our group by taking care of
some of the costs associated with running the group. Also J.D. Heiskell & Co.
has decided to sponsor us as well and provide food for this meetup. We also want
to thank Bitwise Industries for sponsoring us by hosting our meetup at their
offices.
